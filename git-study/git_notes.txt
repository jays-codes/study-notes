@@@@ BP : interactive rebase
	-> git rebase -i
	- only do this for commits that aren't shared yet
	- modifies history of commits
	- use notepad instead of subl

	-> git rebase --abort
	-> git rebase -q
		- this is to cancel in the middle of a rebase
		- if cancelling results with HEAD not pointing to a branch, just checkout the branch
	-> git push -f
		- this is to force the rebase to the remote repo
	BP : for a workflow, you should commit to your local early and often, when ready to finally push the work to a shared repo, you should do an interactive rebase to clean your history

@@@@ BP : reflog
	-> git reflog HEAD
	- list the changes (with their hashes) to the commits pointed to by HEAD, even ones that have been dropped but not garbage collected
	- you can do a git show on a hash from the list

-> git revert <commit>
-revert changes introduced in this commit and records to revert in a new commit. it doesn't mean undo. git reset is more like undo.

- modify the current commit with changes that are currently staged, use commit --amend

@@@@ Settingup git workflow
	-> Distribution Model, Branching Model, Constraints
	Distribution Model: Peer2Peer, Centralized, Pull-Request, Dictator/Lieutenant

	Branching Model
	-> Integration Branch: often called main branch, master, place where things come together and where you solve conflicts. Is often stable. Automated-build systems checks whatever is on this branch

@@@@ BP : copying a remote repo to local 
	-> git clone <repo>

	- this will also copy the root folder from origin so you don't have to recreate the root folder in local. 


@@@@ BP : user error when doing git push
	-> create a personal accesskey in GH and use that key when prompted for the password

Setting up eclipse in GIT

eclipse, GIT, java SOP

+ When creating a new java project
	1. create project
	2. share project as git
	
+ A project is committed to a shared gh repo of and with other related projects. 1 gh repo, 1 or more projects

+ if a project is stand alone, it should have a gh repo of its own. 1 project = 1 gh repo
